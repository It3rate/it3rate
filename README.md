A 2D graphics nested layout tool for vector and bitmap assets

This is a proof of concept layout tool. It allows importing swf files and bitmaps, and then exporting to iOS, Android, web and DirectX. It contains some experimental work for 'retained design metadata', like anchor, align and distribte actions.
